# 🚀 AI Browser Agent Workflow Platform

A portfolio-grade **AI-powered browser workflow platform** built with **FastAPI, Playwright, and Streamlit**.

This project upgrades browser automation from a one-off crawler script into a **platformized workflow system** with:

- task lifecycle orchestration
- structured browser data extraction
- historical task persistence
- trend analytics
- visual dashboard delivery
- production-style API services

It is designed as a **resume-ready AI engineering showcase project** for AI application, workflow, and platform engineering roles.
